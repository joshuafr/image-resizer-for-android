image-resizer-for-android
=========================

A small utility function to quickly resize images for use in Android applications. It takes a specified directory full
of images and writes a scaled down version of those images to a specified output directory. The inputdir, outputdir,
and scaling factor are all currently hard coded. If more features are needed, I will add them at a later time.
